**This project was completed as a part of Khan Academy's Intro to SQL course. For this project I created a table for a bookstore that contained data on the book 
titles, price, book format and page numbers. I then pulled applicable data from it to answer my questions raised.**

CREATE TABLE bookstore (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, price INTEGER, format TEXT, pages INTEGER);

INSERT INTO 
        bookstore VALUES (1, "Demon Slayer", 7, "print", 238);
INSERT INTO 
        bookstore VALUES (2, "Full Metal", 8, "ebook", 250);
INSERT INTO 
        bookstore VALUES (3, "Beserk", 15, "ebook", 105);
INSERT INTO 
        bookstore VALUES (4, "Avatar the Last Airbender", 10, "ebook", 190);
INSERT INTO 
        bookstore VALUES (5, "Game ON!", 7, "ebook", 220);
INSERT INTO 
        bookstore VALUES (6, "Diary of a Wimpy Kid", 12, "ebook", 300);
INSERT INTO 
        bookstore VALUES (7, "Misdirection", 5, "ebook", 189);
INSERT INTO 
        bookstore VALUES (8, "Ice Planet ", 9, "ebook", 330);
INSERT INTO 
        bookstore VALUES (9, "Taken", 10, "ebook", 201);
INSERT INTO 
        bookstore VALUES (10, "Squad", 15, "print", 150);
        
        #1 
**Select all the information from the bookstore table, order the entries by book price.**
SELECT * 
FROM bookstore ORDER BY price DESC;

#2 
**Display the book with the most pages form the bookstore table.**
SELECT MAX(pages)
    FROM bookstore;

#3
**Calculate the avergae price of the books from the bookstore. **
SELECT AVG(price)
    FROM bookstore;
